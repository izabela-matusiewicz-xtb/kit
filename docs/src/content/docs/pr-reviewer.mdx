# Kit AI PR Reviewer

Kit includes a **production-ready AI PR reviewer** that provides professional-grade code analysis with full repository context. Choose from 10 models ranging from $0.005 to $0.91 per review with complete cost transparency.

<Aside type="tip">
**Want to build a custom reviewer?** See the [Build an AI PR Reviewer tutorial](/tutorials/ai_pr_reviewer) to create your own using kit's components.
</Aside>

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install kit (lightweight - no ML dependencies needed for PR review!)
pip install cased-kit

# 2. Set up configuration
kit review --init-config

# 3. Set API keys
export KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
export KIT_ANTHROPIC_TOKEN="sk-ant-your_key"

# 4. Review any GitHub PR
kit review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# 5. Test without posting (dry run)
kit review --dry-run https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

<Aside type="tip">
**Just want the PR reviewer?** The base `pip install cased-kit` gives you everything needed for PR reviews without heavy ML dependencies like PyTorch. If you need semantic search features later, install with `pip install cased-kit[ml]`.

## 💰 Transparent Pricing

Based on real-world testing on production open source PRs:

### Model Options (Large PR Example)

| Model | Typical Cost | Quality | Best For |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **gpt-4.1-nano** | **$0.004** | ⭐⭐⭐ | High-volume, ultra-budget |
| **gpt-4o-mini** | **$0.006** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Surprising for the cost |
| **claude-sonnet-4** | **$0.12** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Recommended** |

**197x price difference** between cheapest and most expensive model.

### Rough Monthly Cost Examples

| Team Size | Budget Model | Recommended 
|-----------|--------------|-------------
| **Small** (20 PRs/month) | $0.12 | $2.40 
| **Medium** (100 PRs/month) | $0.60 | $12
| **Larger** (500 PRs/month) | $3 | $60

<Aside type="tip">
Don't underestimate the smaller models.
GPT-4o-mini (or even nano!) delivers surprisingly useful reviews *when given the right context*. For simple projects, you can get decent AI code reviews for **less than $1/month**. Yes.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Setup API Keys

**GitHub Token**: Get from [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
```bash
export KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
```

**LLM API Keys**: 
```bash
# For Anthropic Claude (recommended)
export KIT_ANTHROPIC_TOKEN="sk-ant-your_key"

# For OpenAI GPT models
export KIT_OPENAI_TOKEN="sk-your_openai_key"
```

### Configuration File

Edit `~/.kit/review-config.yaml`:

```yaml
github:
  token: ghp_your_token_here
  base_url: https://api.github.com

llm:
  provider: anthropic  # or "openai"
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  api_key: sk-ant-your_key_here
  max_tokens: 4000
  temperature: 0.1

review:
  post_as_comment: true
  clone_for_analysis: true
  cache_repos: true
  max_files: 50
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: read
    
    steps:
      - name: AI Code Review
        run: |
          pip install cased-kit
          kit review ${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}
        env:
          KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          KIT_ANTHROPIC_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Advanced Workflows

**Budget-Conscious Setup** (GPT-4.1-nano):
```yaml
- name: Budget AI Review
  run: |
    pip install cased-kit
    # Configure for ultra-low cost
    kit review --model gpt-4.1-nano ${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}
```

**Conditional Reviews**:
```yaml
# Only review non-draft PRs
- name: AI Review
  if: "!github.event.pull_request.draft"
  
# Only review PRs with specific labels  
- name: AI Review
  if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'needs-review')
```

## 📈 What's Next: Roadmap

#### Custom Context & Learning
- **Per-Organization Context**: Store custom guidelines and coding standards
- **Feedback Learning**: Simple database to learn from review feedback
- **Inline Comments**: Post comments directly on specific lines

```bash
# Coming soon
kit profile create --name "company-standards" --file coding-guidelines.md
kit review --profile company-standards <pr-url>
kit feedback <review-id> --helpful --notes "Great catch!"
```
```bash
# Future features
kit review <pr-url> --consensus  # Multiple models
kit review <pr-url> --mode inline  # Line-level comments
```

## 🔍 Advanced Usage

### Cache Management
```bash
# Check cache status
kit review-cache status

# Clean up old repositories  
kit review-cache cleanup

# Clear all cached repositories
kit review-cache clear
```

### Quality Validation

Every review includes objective quality scoring:
- **File References**: Checks if review references actual changed files
- **Specificity**: Measures concrete vs vague feedback  
- **Coverage**: Assesses if major changes are addressed
- **Relevance**: Ensures suggestions align with actual code changes

## 💡 Best Practices

### Cost Optimization
- Use budget models for routine changes, premium for breaking changes
- Leverage caching - repeat reviews of same repo are 5-10x faster
- Set up profiles to avoid redundant context

### Team Adoption
- Start with dry runs to build confidence
- Use budget models initially to control costs
- Create organization-specific guidelines for consistent reviews

### Integration
- Add to CI/CD for all PRs or just high-impact branches
- Use conditional logic to avoid reviewing bot PRs or documentation-only changes
- Monitor costs and adjust model selection based on team needs
