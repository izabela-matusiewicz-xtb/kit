title: Codebase Q&A Bot with Summaries
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a simple question-answering bot for your codebase. The bot will:

1.  Use `DocstringIndexer` to create semantic summaries of each file.
2.  When a user asks a question, use `SummarySearcher` to find relevant file summaries.
3.  Fetch the full code of those top files.
4.  Use `ContextAssembler` to build a concise prompt for an LLM.
5.  Get an answer from the LLM.

This approach is powerful because it combines semantic understanding (from summaries) with the full detail of the source code, allowing an LLM to answer nuanced questions.

## Prerequisites

*   You have `kit` installed (`pip install cased-kit`).
*   You have an OpenAI API key set (`export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`).
*   You have a local Git repository you want to query.

## Steps

<Steps>

1.  **Initialize Components**

    First, let's set up our `Repository`, `DocstringIndexer`, `Summarizer` (for the indexer), `SummarySearcher`, and `ContextAssembler`.

    ```python
    from kit import Repository, DocstringIndexer, Summarizer, SummarySearcher, ContextAssembler
    from kit.summaries import OpenAIConfig 

    # --- Configuration ---
    REPO_PATH = "/path/to/your/local/git/repo" #! MODIFY
    # For DocstringIndexer, persist_dir is where the DB is stored.
    # Let's use a directory for ChromaDB as it might create multiple files.
    INDEX_PERSIST_DIR = "./my_code_qa_index_db/" 

    # Use a specific summarizer model for indexing, can be different from Q&A LLM
    INDEXER_LLM_CONFIG = OpenAIConfig(model="gpt-4o")

    # LLM for answering the question based on context
    QA_LLM_CONFIG = OpenAIConfig(model="gpt-4o") # Or your preferred model
    # MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS is not directly used by ContextAssembler in this simplified flow
    # TOP_K_SUMMARIES = 3 remains relevant for SummarySearcher
    TOP_K_SUMMARIES = 3 
    # --- END Configuration ---

    repo = Repository(REPO_PATH)

    # For DocstringIndexer - requires repo and a summarizer instance
    summarizer_for_indexing = Summarizer(repo=repo, config=INDEXER_LLM_CONFIG) 
    indexer = DocstringIndexer(repo, summarizer_for_indexing, persist_dir=INDEX_PERSIST_DIR)

    # For SummarySearcher - get it from the indexer
    searcher = indexer.get_searcher()

    # For assembling context for the Q&A LLM
    assembler = ContextAssembler(repo)

    # We'll need an LLM client to ask the final question
    qa_llm_client = Summarizer(repo=repo, config=QA_LLM_CONFIG)._get_llm_client()
    print("Components initialized.")
    ```

    Make sure to replace `"/path/to/your/local/git/repo"` with the actual path to your repository.
    Also ensure the directory for `INDEX_PERSIST_DIR` (e.g., `my_code_qa_index_db/`) can be created.

2.  **Build or Load the Index**

    The `DocstringIndexer` needs to process your repository to create summaries and embed them. This can take time for large repositories. We'll check if an index already exists and build it if not.

    ```python
    import os

    # Check based on persist_dir for the indexer
    if not os.path.exists(INDEX_PERSIST_DIR) or not any(os.scandir(INDEX_PERSIST_DIR)):
        print(f"Index not found or empty at {INDEX_PERSIST_DIR}. Building...")
        # Build a symbol-level index for more granular results
        # force=True will rebuild if the directory exists but is perhaps from an old run
        indexer.build(level="symbol", file_extensions=[".py", ".js", ".md"], force=True)
        print("Symbol-level index built successfully.")
    else:
        print(f"Found existing index at {INDEX_PERSIST_DIR}.")
    ```

3.  **Define the Question-Answering Function**

    This function will orchestrate the search, context assembly, and LLM query.

    ```python
    def answer_question(user_query: str) -> str:
        print(f"\nSearching for files/symbols relevant to: '{user_query}'")
        # 1. Search for relevant file/symbol summaries
        search_results = searcher.search(user_query, top_k=TOP_K_SUMMARIES)

        if not search_results:
            return "I couldn't find any relevant files or symbols in the codebase to answer your question."

        print(f"Found {len(search_results)} relevant document summaries.")
        # Reset assembler for each new question to start with fresh context
        current_question_assembler = ContextAssembler(repo)

        # 2. Add relevant context to the assembler
        added_content_identifiers = set() # To avoid adding the same file multiple times if symbols from it are retrieved

        for i, res in enumerate(search_results):
            file_path = res.get('file_path')
            identifier_for_log = file_path
            
            if res.get('level') == 'symbol':
                symbol_name = res.get('symbol_name', 'Unknown Symbol')
                symbol_type = res.get('symbol_type', 'Unknown Type')
                identifier_for_log = f"Symbol: {symbol_name} in {file_path} (Type: {symbol_type})"
            
            print(f"  {i+1}. {identifier_for_log} (Score: {res.get('score', 0.0):.4f})")

            # For simplicity, add the full file content for any relevant file found,
            # whether the hit was file-level or symbol-level.
            # A more advanced version could add specific symbol code using a custom method.
            if file_path and file_path not in added_content_identifiers:
                try:
                    # Add full file content for context
                    current_question_assembler.add_file(file_path)
                    added_content_identifiers.add(file_path)
                    print(f"    Added content of {file_path} to context.")
                except FileNotFoundError:
                    print(f"    Warning: File {file_path} not found when trying to add to context.")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"    Warning: Error adding {file_path} to context: {e}")
        
        if not added_content_identifiers:
             return "Found relevant file/symbol names, but could not retrieve their content for context."

        # 3. Get the assembled context string
        prompt_context = current_question_assembler.format_context()
        
        if not prompt_context.strip():
            return "Could not assemble any context for the LLM based on search results."

        # 4. Formulate the prompt and ask the LLM
        system_message = (
            "You are a helpful AI assistant with expertise in the provided codebase. "
            "Answer the user's question based *only* on the following code context. "
            "If the answer is not found in the context, say so. Be concise."
        )
        final_prompt = f"## Code Context:\n\n{prompt_context}\n\n## User Question:\n\n{user_query}\n\n## Answer:"

        print("\nSending request to LLM...")
        
        # Assuming OpenAI client for this example structure
        # Adapt if using Anthropic or Google
        if isinstance(QA_LLM_CONFIG, OpenAIConfig):
            response = qa_llm_client.chat.completions.create(
                model=QA_LLM_CONFIG.model,
                messages=[
                    {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
                    {"role": "user", "content": final_prompt}
                ]
            )
            answer = response.choices[0].message.content
        # Add elif for AnthropicConfig, GoogleConfig if desired, or abstract further
        else:
            # Simplified fallback or placeholder for other LLMs
            # In a real app, you'd implement the specific API calls here
            raise NotImplementedError(f"LLM client for {type(QA_LLM_CONFIG)} not fully implemented in this example.")

        return answer
    ```

4.  **Ask a Question!**

    Now, let's try it out.

    ```python
    my_question = "How does the authentication middleware handle expired JWTs?"
    # Or try: "What's the main purpose of the UserNotifications class's send_email method?"
    # Or: "Where is the database connection retry logic implemented in the db_utils module?"

    llm_answer = answer_question(my_question)
    print(f"\nLLM's Answer:\n{llm_answer}")
    ```

    ```text title="Example Output (will vary based on your repo & LLM)"
    Components initialized.
    Found existing index at ./my_code_qa_index_db/.

    Searching for files/symbols relevant to: 'How does the authentication middleware handle expired JWTs?'
    Found 3 relevant document summaries.
      1. Symbol: authenticate in src/auth/middleware.py (Type: function, Score: 0.8765)
      2. File: src/utils/jwt_helpers.py (Score: 0.7912)
      3. File: tests/auth/test_middleware.py (Score: 0.7500)

    Sending request to LLM...

    LLM's Answer:
    The `authenticate` function in `src/auth/middleware.py` checks for JWT expiration. If an `ExpiredSignatureError` is caught during token decoding (likely using a helper from `src/utils/jwt_helpers.py`), it returns a 401 Unauthorized response, typically with a JSON body like `{"error": "Token expired"}`.
    ```
